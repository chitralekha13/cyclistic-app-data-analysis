# **Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis**
This project focuses on analyzing the Cyclistic bike-share dataset, consisting of over 5 million records. The goal of this analysis is to uncover ride patterns, trends, and insights that drive data-informed decisions. The analysis includes preprocessing, geospatial analysis, and temporal exploration of bike-share data across Chicago from December 2021 to November 2022.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Eliminated outliers and handled missing values.
Renamed columns for consistency and standardized station names.
Merged monthly data and cleaned rideable_type, ensuring data integrity.
Geospatial Analysis:

Performed geospatial analysis by mapping 100,000+ latitude and longitude points using Folium, visualizing ride patterns and bike station usage.
Grouped station coordinates and clustered ride patterns across Chicago to analyze station usage density.
Ride Trends & Ride Length Analysis:

Explored ride length distribution using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and visualized trip length by user type.
Conducted time-based analysis by extracting ride start times and identifying peak hours, days, and months for usage.
Visualization:

Generated histograms, time series graphs, and pie charts to summarize the proportion of trips by user type and average trip length.
Created a Folium map to visualize the most frequently used bike stations across Chicago.
Geospatial Clustering:

Clustered start and end coordinates based on rounded latitudes and longitudes, using geopy to calculate distances between locations.
The findings of this analysis highlight the significant factors that influence ride behavior, station usage patterns, and seasonal trends in bike share rides.
